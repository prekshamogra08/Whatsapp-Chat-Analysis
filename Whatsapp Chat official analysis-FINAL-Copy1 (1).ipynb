      "05/05/2021, 11:47 - Ayushi chem IIT: Respected Sir, \n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to impute the following few lines for your kind consideration and immediate suitable action. \n",
      "\n",
      "The *Coronavirus pandemic* has hit us hard mentally and physically and it has led to the following issues:-\n",
      "‚Ä¢ Many of the students are infected and they aren't able to attend the classes. They are *mentally and physically drained out*.\n",
      "‚Ä¢ Many students have their dear ones infected, but they are constrained to attend the classes because they fear *missing out on important topics*. This is taking a toll at their *mental health*.\n",
      "‚Ä¢ Our batchmates have lost their dear ones. This *untimely demise* has been devastating and we cannot expect them to be attending classes or prepare for examinations at this stage.\n",
      "‚Ä¢ Conduction of quizzes without thinking about the infected students and *denial of extra quizzes* by conveners has been a matter of huge concern for us. \n",
      "\n",
      "Few points we would like to raise :- \n",
      "\n",
      "‚Ä¢ When many of our professors and tutors were infected with the virus, they were granted leave and we did wait with patience. Now when students, who are much younger to the teachers, are having serious mental and physical issues on account of the virus, nothing is being done for them.\n",
      "‚Ä¢  Students of other colleges have taken stringent actions to have their demands fulfilled. Inspired from these events, students of IIT BHU can also take to such action that will defame the college. We have no other option left, but we care about the college reputation. So it's better if the college imposes the relaxations mentioned. \n",
      "‚Ä¢ IIT Roorkee, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Indore, IIT Hyderabad, IIT Tirupati, MNNIT Allahabad, and many more colleges have given their students tremendous relaxation by suspending classes temporarily. No such action has been taken by our college, which is a matter of criticism and has turned the  college towards disrepute.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we humbly propose the following points to be exercised for reducing the stress and mental load of academics from young minds :\n",
      "‚Ä¢ An *immediate suspension of classes for a period of 10 days (semester break)* so that students work on their mental fatigue and *buckle up for* facing the pandemic and further academic proceedings. \n",
      "‚Ä¢ This will mean an *extension of 10 days in the midsem examination*. (Which was to be conducted on 12th of May)\n",
      "‚Ä¢ An attestation declaring that conveners should *guarantee conduction* of extra quizzes for students who had been infected with coronavirus. \n",
      "‚Ä¢ There must be a procedure for conducting an *extra midsem examination* for students who were infected during the then former midsem examinations. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the wake of the outbreak of a pandemic, we expect the college administration to stand with us, advocate our demands and back us with sensible resolution like as said above. It's high time that the administration takes immediate steps to save its students from this horrendous situation. \n",
      "We await and expect a positive reply.\n",
      "\n",

Previously I didn't gave a damn about what my family used to think but with each passing day I see myself as only a shell of my previous bliss where I was a hard working and a motivated individual, I feel suffocated when I think of my future.I do realise a simple college reopen is far from my a solution to my problems yet I know this very well that I'd be taking some drastic measures If I'm alone in Cooped up in my home, ghar waale kahi bhejte bhi nhi akele aas paas koi dost bhi nhi jo thhe bhi wo college chale gye ab toh kanpur bhi.......yha toh bass whatsapp par bakar kar leta hu kuchh nhi toh hila liya ya toh rr kar liya fir guilt aur cycle repeat*\n",

      "What's faster than light someone asked, I told darkness. It is a time when a person starts getting alone inside. All I can say is, you definitely need to change your friend circle. Even we are alone, but it's the random calls that my batchmate friends do and give me task ki yei course ya yei playlist aaj kr, Yei kha tabiyat thik hoga etc. Human mind need something to distract and thus when you don't have someone who is watching you, you misbehave. So have a friend who can slap you when you do wrong and praise you when you are right, have a friend who gives you task to do and have a friend who does your task when you need help. It doesn't matter if you are from village, city or whatever, move in a bhed chaal, but that bhed chaal should be of positive and successful people, unki bheed mei chalogei toh vo dhakka maar maar kei positive aur successful bana dengei.

      "Hope you are in the best of your health when this E-mail finds you. This is yet another appeal from our side to consider reopening the institute. We are now fed up with the ‚Äúempathy‚Äù emails that we receive from your end. Four semesters are about to be over and we have not even seen the face of the institute. We had even started a boycott in the previous semester and even after those harsh measures the administration did not take any stern measures. After these instances, it feels that you are least bothered about the students. It has become a routine at IIT BHU that the student's email about the issues then we hear that you are ‚Äúworking on it‚Äù and within a week all the efforts go down the drain. Now, We would like to bring to your notice that the Omicron wave has peaked in India and it's high time that the administration starts to plan to call us back rather than send not-so-trustworthy emails. Otherwise, what happens is that you start planning when the wave is over, by your plan 6 months are passed, and when the time comes when the COVID cases increase. In spite of the fact that India is in the third wave, several other IITs and schools have opened. Delhi has started to ease the curbs and schools in Mumbai have been opened. It is an issue of mere common sense that now we need to learn to live with the virus. We cannot sit at home our whole life. We have seen various pictures of events being held on the campus where even our esteemed Director of the institute is seen without a facemask.

We can understand the administration is concerned about ragging, but its a very rare scenario in IITs nowadays; several IITs like Kharagpur, Bombay, and Delhi are used to allot even their 1st and 2nd years along with their senior years. This overcautiousness could simply cost us an entire semester which could be tackled by proper vigilance and awareness campaign by the Students Counseling Service(SCS).\n",

Otherwise at max by 21st March. ( During 6-8 March admins are facing issues of mess service, because mess workers will leave from 12-20 March for Holi break, so for those days they are arranging something. If that is arranged we'll be in campus by 6-8th march. ) Also this time our third yearites will be in campus so pressure will be maintained and things will go fastly ( as said by internal important member, who guided us during all this phase, so we might believe this time).\n",

      "Secondly academics doaa and hostel committee ( cow), dono deans ka aapas me as such coordination nhi. Which means boycott was to make pressure on academics dean ( Doaa), but boycott se hostel committee ke dean ko affect nhi pdega. Hostel committee ka kaam chlta rhega at same pace par jaise abhi chl rha ( at least 5-6 days will be needed for allocation, max 10 days for allocation since it involves 5-6 offices, their agreement and signature).\n",
      "\n",
      " The purpose of boycott was to make doaa active, to send green signal to hostel authorites. So hostel authorites apne kaam me lge h, hostel allocation's work would at least take 5-6 days if Max pace par hua. So Hopefully 10 days max me allocation list final ho jaaygi.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we are giving them their 10 days time for hostel allocation, so we'll resume boycott for now ( academics loss will effect us only), we'll give midsems peacefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll mass mail that we want final hostel allocation list during midsem duration, otherwise by the end of midsem max. We'll resume boycott from 1st March if we'll not get allocation list by end of midsem, this we'll include in mail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the struggle is to convince admins let us come back before Holi holidays i.e 6-8 March, many people are working on those issues, which might get resolved soon and we'll be notified about that. In case (rare chances) if 6-8 March tk nhi bulaya, then for sure 21st March tk bula lia jaayga. \n",

      "We are thankful to the administration for making a tough decision on planning to call us on campus in the month of March. Sir, we have not been to campus since the day we have taken admission to the institute. We request you to reconsider the dates and try to call us by the 7th of March. This request arises from the fact that we have not met our friends till now and we want to stay in campus during Holi. Also, 3rd year has been called from 15th Feb onwards it won't take them more than a week to vacate the Aryabhatta Hostel. If the warden of the Aryabhatta Hostel is taking responsibility to get the hostel vacant strictly within a week then we can be there on the campus by the 7th of March. Even our seniors in the 3rd year have agreed to support  us. Delaying it any further won't be beneficial and will take a toll on our mental health and loss of faith in the administration. \n",
      "\n",
      "For now, we have faith in you that we would be called back by the 7th of March considering the fact that the warden will take strict actions and vacate the hostel by the 5th of March. Considering the situation and the aforesaid facts the student community has decided to end the boycott, but the condition that we should get the *reopening Email by mid-sem* stands true.\n",
      "But delaying in reopening would cause to start the boycott again from the 1st of March.\n",

All other IITs have their students on campus. We are just requesting you to fasten the process of hostel allocation and call us by 7th March.

We have not received any further details from the administration on the on going process of our allotment for 2nd year and we don't have any idea whether the administration is working on the allotment whether we will again be called back in phases, we don't have any idea if the institute is even planning to call us back. Other IITs and NITs have also started calling back their students of 1st year, parents have started to feel discouraged by the works on the administration and are even in doubt if their children will be called back to campus or not since paying lakhs for online teaching is waste of money. Several resource-constrained students have been facing problems since the start of the college and the institute has not even tried to call them. We hope to hear from the administration soon on the details of calling us back to the campus. We hope to get our calling dates by 9th of march \n",

You should know how to maintain the decorum between a senior and a junior . They are here to help you , guide you not to appear for ur exams . This is so so bad that you didn't even know a senior personally and you go to him/her asking straight away to give their exam. As seniors if we are helpful and polite that doesn't give u a reason to do such impractical things. Atleast think before you involve in such things. \n",
